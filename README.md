## Synopsis

Chrome Extension containing the excellent [ElasticSearch Head](https://github.com/mobz/elasticsearch-head) application.

## Motivation

This was created because ElasticSearch 5 removed the ability to run ElasticSearch Head as an Elastic Plugin.  This offers an alternative to self-hosting in your own web server.  It also has the advantage of bypassing CORS without configuring CORS on your Elastic server.

## Installation

Head over to [ElasticSearch Head](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/elasticsearch-head/ffmkiejjmecolpfloofpjologoblkegm) page on the Chrome Web Store.

## Usage

1. Click the extension icon in the toolbar of your web browser.
2. Type the address for your elastic node into the top of the new tab that opened.
3. Click the Connect button.
